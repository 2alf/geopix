# geopix
Probabilistically generated pictograms
<br>
[Live project](http://two.rf.gd/geopix/#)

A simple web-app made with p5.js that generates new abstract pictograms using only lines and geometric objects on every load and click.
You can save the current set of pictograms by tapping `s` on your keyboard. 

This project is what got me invited to participate in creating the neural network for `Centaur Drawings`. 
You can check out this project on [github](https://github.com/parthenocissus/stickmen) or read about it on my [website](http://xladn0.rf.gd/codework.html).
